<p>This is the first article in a series about setting up my own web site using a
Static Site Generator.  The articles in this series are:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In this article, I will introduce the concept of glanceable displays and describe how they can
be of use in an everyday office or household.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-glanceable-displays">What Are Glanceable Displays?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-glanceable-displays" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/glanceable">Dictionary.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 noting or relating to information on an electronic screen that can be understood quickly or at a glance:
glanceable data;
a glanceable scoreboard.</p>
<p>2 enabling information on a screen to be quickly understood:
a glanceable design;
glanceable interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, a glanceable display is a display where we are going to provide information that
can be quickly understood by people reading the display.  An important qualification of these
displays is that the information they display needs to have a broad degree of applicability
without any ability for the reader to customize the data to their needs.</p>
<p>As we have to provide information with no personal customization, it is important to think
about various things up front.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-the-display-for">Who Is the Display For?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-the-display-for" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The audience of the display will drive a lot of the other choices for the glanceable
display.  It is important to be honest about who the glanceable display is for, and what
the requirements are.  If you are not honest, you will invariably end up missing the
goals that you decided on as your base assumptions were not correct.</p>
<p>As an aside, I have often heard of concerns like this being addressed as SAF, Spousal
Acceptance Factor.  </p>
<h2 id="how-are-you-going-to-display-it">How Are You Going To Display It?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-are-you-going-to-display-it" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In terms of deciding how to display the glanceable information, we really have only one
decision to make: are we going to ask the viewer to visit a display site with a device or are
we going to provide access to a device at a given location?</p>
<p>If you decide on the visit paradigm, you don&rsquo;t have any hardware concerns, but have to make
sure that the data you are displaying will be available when needed.  With the viewer using
their own device to view the display, another decision must be made regarding whether to
standardize on a single device type or to support multiple device types.  If you decide to
support multiple device types, you will probably need to use an intermediate step where you
start with support for the most used device type.  Once that device type has been completed,
you can then slowly adapt your display to the next device type your viewers are using.</p>
<p>If you decide on the given location paradigm, you limit your device type to one, but you take
on additional hardware concerns.  You get to focus on a single device type, but you need to
provide for the setup and control of that device.  Consider the case where the power goes off
and then comes back.  How will your hardware solution handle that?  Another important
consideration is the cost of the hardware and any needed peripherals.  Will you reuse existing
hardware that you already have, or will you require expenditures?</p>
<p>The output from your evaluation of this section should be a choice of approach and a list of
reasons why the selected approach was chosen.  If possible, provide as many details as possible
as it will help you in other sections going forward.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-need-to-consider-up-front">What Do You Need To Consider Up Front?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-you-need-to-consider-up-front" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h2 id="what-are-you-going-to-display">What Are You Going To Display?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-you-going-to-display" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h2 id="the-decisions-for-our-glanceable-display">The Decisions for Our Glanceable Display<a class="headerlink" href="#the-decisions-for-our-glanceable-display" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Understanding that any decision would affect the entire family, I asked if we could talk
about it after dinner one night.  In discussing the possibility of a display, we all agreed
that there were common things that it would be nice to see.  These things came down to 3
categories: calendar related, weather related, and other.</p>
<p>As we all have busy lives, the calendar was a slam dunk.  Our whiteboard calendar didn&rsquo;t get
updated when it should, which left us looking at our online calendars on our phones.  But even
with our own calendars, it was a pain to remember to invite other family members to any
meetings we had, regardless of whether or not they needed to be there.  Having a single place
to display that information keyed to a given individual would clear things up and simplify
things a lot.</p>
<p>Information on the weather was another category, mostly due to the Seattle weather.  While my
son wears the same type of clothes every day, my wife and I vary our clothing by the type of
weather and activities we have planned.  Having that advance knowledge would cut down on
having to actively seek that information from a number of online sources.  There were also some
other little things brought up, and hence the others category was formed.</p>
<p>The discussion moved to decide which class of glanceable display to use, and our family made a
simple decision to go with a monitor driven by a web page hosted on a Raspberry Pi.  We all
agreed that we wanted something that would replace a seldom updated whiteboard calendar in our
kitchen.  It needed to be big enough to show several weeks worth of calendar at a time, to
allow us to plan that far out.  We also wanted to make sure we kept each other honest, so we
explicitly wanted it not tied to any of our personal computers and tied to a location that we
know we all frequent: the kitchen.  The choice of the Raspberry Pi was based on a number of
articles that I had read, with promises that I would do the maintaining of it.</p>
<p>So, from those discussions, I arrived at the following.  </p>
<h3 id="audience">Audience<a class="headerlink" href="#audience" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The audience was all of our family.</p>
<h3 id="display">Display<a class="headerlink" href="#display" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The display itself would be a simple Raspberry Pi with a monitor that was left from a project
that I had worked on.  The display would be located in the kitchen in a location that would
be visible to family members, but not visible outside of the house.</p>
