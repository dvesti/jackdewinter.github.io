            <p>If you care to look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackdewinter/">LinkedIn profile</a>, you&rsquo;ll
see that I have been around for a while.  Starting in 1991 in a small 2 person company in
Waterloo, I was a developer for many years until a stint in Denmark gave me a bit of a wakeup
call.  When I came back to the United States in January 2011, I changed from a developer to
a developer in test.  While I started my career &ldquo;making things that work&rdquo;, after 20 years
I was more focused on &ldquo;making things work better&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To be specific, I am not a tester.  I do know a lot about testing, but that is not my
primary focus.  My focus is on looking at interconnected systems and figuring out how to
improve them.  It is not about breaking things, like a lot of people assume, but making the
team around me better.  It is about standing up and mentioning that while developers like
being creative, having 5 developers struggle through the same setup process for 4 days each
is just plain inefficient.  It is as much about asking the simple, but tough questions, as it
is about having an idea on how to respond to both the questions and answers that follow that
tough question.</p>
<p>The actual job is almost always about automation or process, it almost always involves changing
the way people look at things, and unfortunately it almost always includes having someone&rsquo;s ego
bruised along the way.  The first one is the easy part for me.  Partially due to me having
Autism, I can see certain patterns very easily, almost as if I was reading a book.  Changing
the way people look at things almost always brings around the bruised egos.  A lot of
developers associate code they right with themselves.  As such, saying that the code or
process can be improved becomes confused with saying that the developers themselves can be
improved.</p>
<p>And yes, when that happens, it is often the people asking the questions and making suggestions
on how to make things better that take the brunt of the anger that results.</p>
<p>I still remember my daughter asking me one time why I was a developer in test, as I am often
frustrated with people over a perceived lack of momentum.  Thinking about it quickly, the
immediate answer was easy: I was good at a decent part of it.  If you are in a box and looking
around you, all you see is the box.  I am able to elevate my perspective to a higher level
and not only see the one box, but the boxes around it.  I can see how they are stacked, and
if they are looking like they will tip over.  That came second nature to me. But it wasn&rsquo;t the
complete answer.</p>
<p>It was during one of those teaching moments we as parents have with our children that it
occurred to me.  I was reminding one of my children that we have a saying in our family: being
knocked flat on your ass is not the last step, it&rsquo;s just the step before we pick ourselves up,
we brush ourselves off, and we try again.  Yeah, having issues and making mistakes sucks, but
they helped make us who we are, and it&rsquo;s how we stand up again that defines us.</p>
<p>It was then that I realized: I became a developer in test because it was hard.  I wanted the
challenge to make things better, and to help other get better at what they were doing.  I knew
I was going to encounter stubborn people along the way, but I was determined that I would try
and figure out a way to get through to them.  Sure, I get knocked flat on my rear end a fair
number of times, but I always get back up and try again.</p>
<p>That takes me to the last couple of months.</p>
<p>For a long time I have wanted to start my own blog and help out an open source project.  I was
under no illusion that either objective was going to be easy, I just didn&rsquo;t have a clue about
how different it would evolve into from what I thought it originally was.</p>
<p>As I was going through and picking out a platform for my blog, I kept notes and started to
turn them into articles.  That was relatively easy.  Or at least the first pass was.  I found
out that when it comes to articles, I want to make sure I am saying the right thing in the
right way, and can literally spend 45 minutes working on one sentence.   Shortly after that,
I also learned that I can spend 5 minutes getting said sentence in a way that makes sense,
add text a marker like <code>**TBD**</code> before it, and then come back to it at the end of the article.
And yes, following that, I realized that about half the time, going downstairs and doing
something totally unrelated caused me to think of <strong>THE EXACT</strong> phrase that I needed within
seconds of coming back after the break.  Yup, learning is fun, and hindsight is perfect!</p>
<p>This blog isn&rsquo;t hard in terms of writing for me, but the production of it sometimes gets me.
You have to give yourself some kind of schedule if you want to stay on track, and for me it
was to publish once a week on something technical.  It is a challenge to make sure you
have a couple of articles on the go at any time, and that you can polish one up and
publish it on a weekly basis.  I also have to balance the writing with exploring stuff so that
I can write about it in my blog.  And I realized I have to extend that out 4-6 weeks to give
me time to go through a good ideation process.</p>
<p>Going through all of this, my attention was also drawn to the Elegant theme that I use
for this website.  They asked for people to help with documentation, and I decided that it was
another challenge I wanted to accept.  So take the work I was doing with my blog, subtract the
subject matter research, add some localized research in certain cases, and supplement that
with making sure I write in a more profession tone.  On top of that, apply a bit of my
developer in test training and try and make sure I have a solid theme, and that I am making
the process easier for me and other users of Elegant in the process.</p>
<p>For sure, doing these things at the same time can be nuts, but I am thoroughly enjoying the
challenge.  I am growing both personally and professionally as I work though things on each
project, some inside of my expertise and some outside of it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish there were more hours in the day, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade the learning for the world.</p>
