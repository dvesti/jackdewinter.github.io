<p>In setting up this website, I needed to make sure I had Git<sup id="fnref:Git"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Git">1</a></sup> and more specifically
GitHub <sup id="fnref:GitHub"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:GitHub">2</a></sup> setup to use GitHub&rsquo;s GitHub Pages<sup id="fnref:GitHubPages"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:GitHubPages">3</a></sup> feature.  My source
control tool of choice was already Git, so it made sense to make my website platform of
choice GitHub Pages<sup id="fnref2:GitHubPages"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:GitHubPages">3</a></sup>.  I made this choice to ensure that I can write articles
with little or not changes to my normal workflows.  Part of any project I do, private or
open-source, is setting up a version control system and securing access to that version
control system.  It is always a high priority for me to make sure that any Git access is
secure and follows best common practices on security.</p>
<p>This article details the actions and choices I made in setting up my access to GitHub for my
blog.  It details how I followed the GitHub Pages instructions for creating a personal website
and creating a personal repository on GitHub to achieve that.  Then it describes the two modes
of accessing GitHub, SSH and HTTPS, and why I chose SSH.  Finally, it provides detailed notes
on how I generated a SSH keypair specifically for GitHub, and configured both my local Git and
the remote GitHub to use them.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-github">Getting Started With GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started-with-github" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are many good articles out there on how to install Git for different operating systems,
so I&rsquo;ll assume any readers following along can do the research needed to install Git for their
system.  Setting up access to GitHub is even easier as the folks at GitHub have provided
excellent instructions.  Simply go to the <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub Home Page</a> and it will
either allow you to login if you have an account, or create a new account if you don&rsquo;t.  As I
had already dealt with a couple of open source projects, I already have an account
<code>jackdewinter</code>, so I logged in without any issues.</p>
<p>After I logged in, the browser deposited me on my home page.  From there I was able to see
any projects that I had either contributed to or filed an issue against.  Just starting in my
Open Source journey, the contents were only a couple of projects that I had filed issues with.
Prior to this point, I had no need to authenticate my Git client with GitHub as I was just
downloading from public repositories.  I figured out quickly that setting up my own website
would require my own repositories, so I determined that authentication would also be required.</p>
<h2 id="creating-my-first-github-repository">Creating My First GitHub Repository<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-my-first-github-repository" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages home page</a> has a really simple formula on their
webpage for setting up personal webpages.  Step 1 was pretty easy: I made sure that
that the name of the repository was my GitHub user id (in my case <code>jackdewinter</code>) followed by
<code>.github.io</code>.  When the creation of my repository finished, GitHub deposited my browser
at the base of my new repository: <code>jackdewinter/jackdewinter.github.io</code>.</p>
<p>The remaining steps in the formula dealt with cloning the repository, defining a sample
<code>index.html</code> file for my website, and pushing that code back to the repository.  While I was
familiar with those concepts, I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to check back with the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">Git Basics documentation</a>
on the Git website when I forgot something.  From there I can usually find the correct helper
article on what I need to accomplish within 2-3 clicks.</p>
<p>The new concept that I had to deal with on the GitHub site is that unlike before, I was now
accessing a repository that was privately owned that I wanted to write to.  Unless you mark a
repository as private, everyone can see that repository and read from that repository.  My
website&rsquo;s repository is public, so reading wasn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>
<p>Pushing the code back to the my repository would be a write, and was a problem.  Each project
has a list of who can write to it and the creator of the project is on that list by default.
But to write to the project, I had to have my local Git tool login to GitHub when needed and
authenticate.  I was going to have to dive into credentials.</p>
<h2 id="github-authentication-ssh-vs-https">GitHub Authentication: SSH vs HTTPS<a class="headerlink" href="#github-authentication-ssh-vs-https" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Every time you log in to a website or to a program by using your user id and password, you
establish your credentials.  You tell the website or program &ldquo;I can prove I am me, let me see
my stuff!&rdquo;.  The GitHub website is no different that any of those sites.  If you want to be
able to see any of your private stuff or write to your stuff, it needs to verify who you are.</p>
<p>Going to the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git">GitHub Authenticating Page</a>,
there are two choices that allow us to connect to GitHub: HTTPS and SSH.  Both of these are
valid options, allowing for enhanced security when having Git connect to GitHub.  However,
each of these options has different things going for and against it.  After doing some
research, it seemed to me to break down to the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>SSH</th>
<th>HTTPS</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>set up keys</td>
<td>set up credential manager</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>setup is more involved</td>
<td>easy setup</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>more secure</td>
<td>less likely blocked by firewall</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Looking at this information, I decided to go with SSH as I wanted to opt for more security.</p>
<h2 id="ssh-access-to-github">SSH Access to GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#ssh-access-to-github" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>During my research at the GitHub site, I had found this very good page on
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-ssh-over-the-https-port">SSH over the HTTPS port</a>.
In it, they explain that there is a simple test to see if SSH will work from your system to
GitHub.  When you execute the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ssh -T git@github.com
</pre></div>


<p>it will either return one of two responses.  If it returns with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; Hi *username*! You&#39;ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
</pre></div>


<p>then you can access GitHub via SSH without any issues.  If you see the other response:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection timed out
</pre></div>


<p>then you have to setup SSH to connect to GitHub over the HTTPS port.  This access can be
verified with a small modification to the above command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
</pre></div>


<p>The command is now trying to establish a SSH session over port 443, and if you get the
<code>You've successfully</code> response, it&rsquo;s working fine.  Running these tests myself, I found
that I got a timeout on the first command and a success on the second command.  Following
the article, it recommends changes <code>~/.ssh/config</code>[^SSH_CONFIG] to include the following:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>My primary system is a Windows 10 machine, so instead of modifying the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file, I modified the <code>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.ssh\config</code> file.  On my system, that file is the <code>c:\Users\jackd\.ssh\config</code> file.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
</pre></div>


<p>The next time, when I executed the <code>ssh -T git@github.com</code> command, the response was
the <code>You've successfully</code> response.  Now I was ready to set up the SSH keys.</p>
<h2 id="unique-ssh-keys">Unique SSH Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#unique-ssh-keys" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Going back to the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git">GitHub Authenticating Page</a>,
the next step was to generate a new SSH key pair and add it to my local SSH keyring.  The page
that it points to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">on generating a new key</a>
is pretty detailed, so I won&rsquo;t try and improve over GitHub&rsquo;s work.  On my reading of the page,
it seems to assume that if you will only have 1 key pair<sup id="fnref:keypair"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:keypair">4</a></sup> generated and that you will
reuse that key pair for GitHub.  I have issues with that practice, so I want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Having a bit of a security background from my day job, I want to limit exposure if something
gets broken.  Just from a quick search, there are articles by
<a href="https://askleo.com/why-is-it-so-important-to-use-a-different-password-on-every-site/">Leo Notenboom</a>,
<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2017/05/dont-need-27-different-passwords/">Malware Bytes Labs</a>, and
<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Have-Many-Different-Passwords-for-Many-Different-Websites">WikiHow</a>
that all describe how you should have different passwords for each account, and in many cases,
use a password manager.  And to be honest, that was just the first 3 that I clicked on.  There
were a lot more.  </p>
<p>I can sum up and paraphrase the justification raised in each of those articles by posing a
single question: If someone breaks your password on one site, what is your exposure?  If you
have one password for all sites, then whoever breaks your password has access to that one
site.  If you have a different password for each site, the damage is limited to that one site.</p>
<p>In my mind, using a key pair for credentials is a similar concept to using a user-id and
password for credentials.  Therefore, it followed that if I follow good security practices for
passwords, I should also follow the same practices for key pairs as credentials.</p>
<h2 id="generating-a-new-key-for-github">Generating a New Key For GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-a-new-key-for-github" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To ensure I have secure access to GitHub, I followed the instructions
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">for generating a new key</a>.
To generate a distinct key pair for GitHub, I made one small modification to the instructions:
I saved the new key pair information with the filename <code>github-key</code> instead of the default
<code>id_ras</code>.  This resulted in the files <code>~/.ssh/github-key</code> and <code>~/.ssh/github-key.pub</code>
being created as the key pair.  With those files created, I followed the remaining
instructions for setting up ssh-agent and uploading the key information to GitHub, replacing
any occurrence of <code>id_ras</code> with <code>github-key</code>.</p>
<p>With that accomplished, I had a specific key pair for GitHub and I had it registered locally.
I also had setup GitHub with the public portion of the credentials using the contents of
<code>~/.ssh/github-key.pub</code>, as instructed.  The only remaining step was ensure that any SSH
connections to GitHub would use the GitHub credentials. Doing a bit more research on the SSH
configuration files, I quickly found that there was built in support for this by adding the
following to my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Host github.com
  User git
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile /c/Users/jackd/.ssh/github-key
</pre></div>


<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The location of <code>~/</code> on my Windows machine is <code>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\</code> or <code>c:\Users\jackd\</code>.  The format for the <code>IdentityFile</code> property is a standard Unix path format.  This requires a translation from the Windows path format <code>C:\Users\jackd\.ssh\github-key</code> to the Unix path format of <code>/c/Users/jackd/.ssh/github-key</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Combined with the change from earlier in this article, my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file now looked like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
  User git
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile /c/Users/jackd/.ssh/github-key
</pre></div>


<p>I performed a number of thorough tests, and everything passed without any issues!</p>
<h2 id="what-was-accomplished">What Was Accomplished<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-accomplished" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This article started with my creation of a GitHub repository to contain
the files for my personal website using GitHub Pages.  To securely access the repository, I
chose the SSH protocol and discovered that I needed to employ SSH over HTTP.  For enhanced
security, I described a solid reason for wanting a unique SSH key for GitHub.  Following that
advice, I generated a new key and then changed the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to use SSH over HTTPS
and to point to that newly generated keypair.</p>
